# 70 Days of Machine Learning ðŸš€  
This repository contains my daily progress in Machine Learning.  

## ðŸ“… Daily Progress  

### âœ… Day 1: Vectors and Matrices  
On the first day, I explored fundamental concepts related to vectors and matrices, including:  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Vectors**  
- Types of vectors  
- Distance from the origin  
- **Euclidean Distance**  
- Scalar addition, multiplication, and subtraction  
- **Dot Product** and its significance  
- **Angle between two vectors**  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Hyperplane**  
- Understanding the equation of a hyperplane  

#### ðŸ”¹ **Matrices**  
- Types of matrices  
- Matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)  
- Properties of matrices  
- **Determinant** and its role  
- **Inverse of a matrix**
