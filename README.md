# 70 Days of Machine Learning 🚀  
This repository contains my daily progress in Machine Learning.  

## 📅 Daily Progress  

### ✅ Day 1: Vectors and Matrices  
On the first day, I explored fundamental concepts related to vectors and matrices, including:  

#### 🔹 **Vectors**  
- Types of vectors  
- Distance from the origin  
- **Euclidean Distance**  
- Scalar addition, multiplication, and subtraction  
- **Dot Product** and its significance  
- **Angle between two vectors**  

#### 🔹 **Hyperplane**  
- Understanding the equation of a hyperplane  

#### 🔹 **Matrices**  
- Types of matrices  
- Matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication)  
- Properties of matrices  
- **Determinant** and its role  
- **Inverse of a matrix**


## Day 2: Linear Algebra & ML Basics 🚀  

### 🔢 Linear Algebra Concepts:  
- Basis Vectors, Linear Transformations (2D & 3D)  
- Matrix Multiplication, Determinants & Inverses  

### 🤖 Introduction to Machine Learning:  
- **Supervised Learning** (Regression, Classification)  
- **Unsupervised Learning** (Clustering, Anomaly Detection)  
- **Reinforcement Learning** (Reward-based Learning)  

### ⚠️ Overfitting vs. Underfitting:  
| Issue         | Definition | Solution |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Overfitting  | Memorizes training data, fails on new data | Reduce complexity, more data, regularization |
| Underfitting | Too simple, fails on both train & test | Increase model complexity, better features |

### 🔄 Data Challenges:  
1️⃣ Poor Quality & Irrelevant Features  
2️⃣ Insufficient or Non-Representative Training Data  
3️⃣ Data Mismatch (Train vs. Real-world Data)  

## 📂 Working with JSON & SQL (Pandas)  

### ✅ Read & Write JSON:  
```python
import pandas as pd  
df = pd.read_json("data.json")  
df.to_json("output.json", orient="records", indent=4)
```
📅 Day 3: Simple Linear Regression & My First Model

Today, I learned about Simple Linear Regression, a fundamental concept in machine learning.
📌 Key Learnings:

 -  Understanding Linear Regression: Predicting a dependent variable (Y) based on an independent variable (X).

 - Equation of Regression Line:
 -   Y=mX+cY=mX+c
 -  where m is the slope and c is the intercept.

 - Training My First Model: Used Scikit-learn to create and train a linear regression model.

 -  Visualizing Results: Plotted regression line to understand predictions.
